== Istio Workspace

Do you have confidence that your Test and Stage environments reflect reality? Are they easy to keep up-to-date with production? Can you reproduce production failure in these environments or locally? What about that error you keep seeing on production that’s never occurring on Test or Stage?

This project works with https://istio.io/[Istio] and https://k8s.io[Kubernetes] or https://openshift.com[Openshift] to give you confidence that your changes won't blow up production cluster and your users won’t even notice a glitch.

You can read more about our vision on https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/14/developing-and-testing-on-production-with-kubernetes-and-istio-workspace/[Red Hat Developer's blog] or ...

=== Documentation

More details can be found on our https://istio-workspace-docs.netlify.com/[documentation page]. 

We use amazing https://antora.org/[Antora] project to build it and you should too!

=== Install (in two easy steps)

Get latest `ike` binary through simple download script:

[source,bash]
----
curl -sL http://git.io/get-ike | bash
----

TIP: You can also specify the version and directory before downloading `curl -sL http://git.io/get-ike | bash -s \-- --version=v0.0.1 --dir=/usr/bin`

[source,bash]
----
get - downloads ike binary matching your operating system
 
./get.sh [options]
 
Options:
-h, --help          shows brief help
-v, --version       defines version specific version of the binary to download (defaults to latest)
-d, --dir           target directory to which the binary is downloaded (defaults to random tmp dir in /tmp suffixed with ike-version)
-n, --name          saves binary under specific name (defaults to ike)

----

When logged in to the cluster run the following for a cluster wide operator:

[source,bash]
----
ike install-operator
----

or if you only want to install the operator for a single namespace run:

[source,bash]
----
ike install-operator -l
----

And you are all set!

=== Development Setup

Assuming that you have all the https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place, clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/maistra/istio-workspace $GOPATH/src/github.com/maistra/istio-workspace
----

We rely on following tools:

* https://golang.github.io/dep/[`dep`] for dependency management
* https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[`golang-ci`] linter
* https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo[`ginkgo`] for testing
* https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports[`goimports`] for formatting
* https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[`operator-sdk`] for code generation

but from now on you are ready to hack - invoking `make` will check if those binaries are available and install if there are some missing.

Run `make help` to see what targets are available, but you will use `make` most often.

NOTE: Have a look how https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration
and management of different versions of Go.

==== Coding style

We follow standard Go coding conventions which we ensure using `goimports` during the build. 

In addition we provide `.editorconfig` file which is supported by https://editorconfig.org/#download[majority of the IDEs].
