= Istio Workspace

== Development

=== Setup

Assuming that you have all the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place, clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/maistra/istio-workspace $GOPATH/src/github.com/maistra/istio-workspace
----

then run `make tools` which will take care of installing all the tools mentioned below:

* link:https://golang.github.io/dep/[`dep`] for dependency management
* link:https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[`golang-ci`] linter
* link:https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo[`ginkgo`] for testing
* link:https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports[`goimports`] for formatting
* link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[`operator-sdk`] for code generation

From now on you are ready to hack. Run `make help` to see what targets are available, but you will use
`make build` and `make test` most often.

NOTE: Have a look how link:https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration
and management of different versions of Go.
