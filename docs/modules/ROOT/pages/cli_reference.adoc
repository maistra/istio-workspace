= CLI Reference

In this section you will learn about:

* [x] ways to configure `ike` (through flags, files et al)
* [x] complete list of commands and their available flags

[#completion]
== Autocomplete

If you are using `zsh` or `bash` you can easily enable autocomplete for `ike` by invoking `. <(ike completion SHELL)`.

[#configuration]
== Configuration

There are several ways to configure `ike` commands:

. Flags
. Environment variables
. Configuration file

Each item takes precedence over the item below it.

Environment variables are prefixed with `IKE` and have fully qualified names, for example
in case of `develop` command and its `port` flag corresponding environment variable is
`IKE_DEVELOP_PORT`.

Each of the commands can be persisted in the configuration file with all their flags respectively.

In case of `develop` command `yaml` file could look like:

[source,yml]
----
develop:
  deployment: test
  run: "java -jar config.jar"
  port: 9876
----

See <<ike,ike root command>> to learn about the global config flag and available formats.

Below you can find a documented list of all commands and their available flags.

== Available commands

[#ike]
=== `ike`

Main command, which holds global flags and prints the overall usage of the tool.

include::cmd:ike[flags='--help --help-format=adoc']

[#ike-install-operator]
=== `ike install-operator`

Simple installation process of the operator in the cluster. 

IMPORTANT: Connection configuration is taken from `KUBECONFIG` context. 
It's important to have user with sufficient privileges. 
In case of OpenShift you can add `cluster-user` role for your user by executing 
`oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin USER`. 

include::cmd:ike[flags='install-operator --help --help-format=adoc']

[#ike-serve]
=== `ike serve`

Starts the operator in the cluster.
// TODO brief mention about operator and how it works + link to the dedicated docs

include::cmd:ike[flags='serve --help --help-format=adoc']

[#ike-create]
=== `ike create`

Creates or joins existing development session in the cluster. Allows to re-route cluster network traffic to your local process.

The `create` command requires an image-reference to a repository which is reachable from within the cluster. It will prepare a session with the given image.

IMPORTANT: The `create` command will exit and leave the `Session` alive in the cluster as soon as it's created.

include::cmd:ike[flags='create --help --help-format=adoc']


[#ike-delete]
=== `ike delete`

Deletes or leaves existing development session in the cluster.

include::cmd:ike[flags='delete --help --help-format=adoc']

[#ike-develop]
=== `ike develop`

Creates or joins existing development session in the cluster. Allows to re-route cluster network traffic to your local process.

include::cmd:ike[flags='develop --help --help-format=adoc']

==== Watching for changes

`ike develop` provides `--watch` functionality to trigger build and relaunch the process whenever you modify something
in your project. This way you can immediately introduce your changes in your cluster.

By default all log files (`*.log`) and `.git` folder are not monitored.

TIP: For details on how define what should be watched see <<ike-develop,ike develop>> reference.

If you have `.gitignore` in the root directory, from where `ike` has been started, rules defined in this file
are also respected.

TIP: Have a look at https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore[official Git documentation] to learn more about the `.gitignore` format.

WARNING: Only root `.gitignore` is handled. If you happen to have additional `.gitignore` files in subdirectories
those won't be respected.

[#ike-version]
=== `ike version`

Prints version of the binary and build metadata.
include::cmd:ike[flags='version',block=true,print=true]
