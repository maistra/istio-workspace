== Automation

=== Release Process

Release automation is based on a tagged commit (i.e. named `release: v0.0.1` with associated annotated tag `v0.0.11)
Such a commit should have the following content:

. The version in `docs/antora.yml` changed to a matching `tag`
. Release notes named after tag `tag.adoc` in `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/release_notes/`
. New release included in `docs/modules/ROOT/pages/release_notes.adoc`

NOTE: Above steps are provided by `scripts/release.sh`

Such tagged commit triggers a job in CircleCI which will:

. Build and push tagged docker image to `quay.io` registry
. Push cross-compiled binaries and release notes

Diagram below describes the entire process and its artifacts.
