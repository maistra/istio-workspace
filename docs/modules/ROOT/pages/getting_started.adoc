In this section we walk you through necessary steps to start using `ike`. It will take you just a few minutes to start coding!

== What do you need

* [x] `oc` or `kubectl`
* [x] https://www.telepresence.io/reference/install[Telepresence] CLI tool (and required runtime dependencies)
* [x] Ike binary


== Using `ike` CLI

[source,bash]
----

ike develop  \
  --deployment details-v1 \
  --port 9080 \
  --watch \
  --run 'ruby details.rb 9080' \
  --route header:end-user=alien-ike \
----

Let's break it down to see what is going on under the hood.

Now you have process based on your local code base which proxies connections to your Kubernetes cluster! Have fun hacking!

NOTE: `// TODO add screencast showing the basic flow`

NOTE: `// TODO add sources to our binary once released`

NOTE: `// TODO single install script`
