== Highlights of v0.0.8 release

=== Watch dependent resources for change

The operator will now watch all the dependent resources (`DestinationRule`, `Gateway`, `VirtualService`, `Deployment`)
and reconcile the `Session` on any change.

This means that even if a third-party tool reconfigures the current state, overwrites it, or pushes new releases, the operator will ensure that the special route is still operational.
