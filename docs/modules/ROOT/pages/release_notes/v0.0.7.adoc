== Highlights of v0.0.7 release

=== Route available in Status

You can use the Route option to define the criteria you want to use for this Session either via `Session.Spec.Route` or via the `--route` CLI option. If you don't, the operator will calculate a route for you using `header:x-workspace-route:"session.name"`.

You can now find the currently used Route reflected in `Session.Status.Route`.

=== Improvement to CustomResourceDefintion and ClusterServiceVersion

We've added better descriptions and some field-level documentation to the `CustomResourceDefintion` and the `ClusterServiceVersion`
