== Highlights of v0.0.3 release

This release is mainly focused around improving stability and refactorings, but there is one notable feature worth mentioning.

=== Resolution of host name for target Resource

As users are completely free to name Target Resource(`Deployment` or `DeploymentConfig`), Service and VirtualServices etc, we improved resolution strategy which previously relied on pattern matching.

By resolving Services that could possibly match the Target Resource, we look for all Virtual Services that specify that `Service/Host`.
