== Highlights of v0.5.2 release

This small release comes with one bug fix and one tiny improvement which makes developer experience while using `ike` CLI more pleasant. 

=== Autocompletion for flags with limited options

For flags which have limited options we have enabled autocompletion showing only the possible values. For example:

[source,bash]
$ ike develop --method <TAB>
inject-tcp  vpn-tcp   

=== Fixed `--watch` default behaviour

We've also discovered small, but a bit annoying bug of a `--watch` feature. 

With the default settings whenever you did something in Git while running `ike develop` it was restarting the service under development. That should be behaving correctly now - it only restarts the service when you change the code, not Git internals :)
