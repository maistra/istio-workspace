== Highlights of v0.5.0 release

This long postponed release has been cooking for a while, but it's finally here!

There's one important change - to have our own, distinct naming we prefixed `maistra.io` `apiGroup` with `workspace.` across the project. So all existing sessions won't be recognized by this version.

From this version onward we are collecting metrics on internal our calls, so you have an insight to what our controller is doing.

On top of that we optimized network traffic by leveraging `PATCH` operations instead of `PUT` when manipulating our existing resources.

And to top this announcement off with a screenshot - `Session` custom resource is now shown as a wheel icon in Openshift :)
