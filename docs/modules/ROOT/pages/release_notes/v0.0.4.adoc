== Highlights of v0.0.4 release

This release has been primarily focused on hardening our test infrastructure and use cases coverage. This obviously resulted in quite a bit of improvements in our infra as well as bug fixes which you can see in the complete changelog below. There are a few notable change though.

=== Host-based routing

Up until now we provided header-based routing, where you added your custom header (e.g. `X-PR-Route: 461`) based on which the traffic was routed to the changed services. This feature adds a subdomain host to the gateway and let you access your changed service by using just a URL, so you can easily use your browser to test it.

=== Get the structural response from the `ike create` command

For simplicity and automation you might want to get the `Session` object that was created by the `ike create` command as part of the response. You can now do that by including the `--json` argument, and the resulting `Session` object will be printed to `stdout`.

=== `ike install-operator` is now `ike install`

We decided to rename installation command for two simple reasons - it's obviously shorter, but it also better reflects what is happening under the hood. It installs `istio-workspace` controller, the same way as an https://operatorframework.io/[operator] would do.
