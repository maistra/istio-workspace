== Highlights of v0.4.0 release

This release brings significant refactoring of `istio-workspace` controller internals. We have rewritten how we validate, locate and manipulate resources involved in the development `Session`. That said, it does not affect the users. That's the aim of refactoring after all ;)

In addition, we expose `Conditions` to indicate steps and their progress. Now you are able track the current state of the session via the `session.status.state` field. We keep it simple for time being, with tree simple states:

  * `processing` which can transition to 
  * `failed` if things go wrong,
  * or `succeeded` if all went fine.

On top of that you can look at the state of the individual resources manipulated in the conditions list where the source field references the specific resource.
