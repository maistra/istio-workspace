== Highlights of v0.0.2 release

Below you will find an exhaustive list of all the improvements since last release, but those are the most important changes:

=== Support for multiple development strategies

In `v0.0.1` we only supported preparation of a telepresence session. In this release we've expanded this to allow specifying a strategy per Ref in the Session object. 

Currently, we support two strategies: `telepresence` for local development and `prepared-image`.

The new `prepared-image` strategy allow you to setup a route for a pre-built image. It is a perfect fit for a CI system.

When using ike cli, the `develop` command will use the `telepresence` strategy while `create` will use the 
`prepared-image` strategy. The `create` command is non blocking compared to `develop`. The `create` command comes with 
a companion command `delete` to clean up when e.g. PR is merged.

=== Installing operator locally

Now you also can deploy operator to your local namespace, so where your project lives. This way only your namespace is watched.

Simply invoke `ike install-operator -l`
