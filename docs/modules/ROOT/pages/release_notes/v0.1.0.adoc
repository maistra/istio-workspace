== Highlights of v0.1.0 release

=== Specifying the exact resource to be manipulated

If you run commands targeting resources, such as `Deployment`, till now you were only able to use `Name`. This resulted in a lookup among the resources we currently handle. First we checked if `Deployment` of the matching name is available. If not - we looked up for `DeploymentConfig`. 

With this release you can be exact:

[source,bash]
----
$ ike create --deployment deployment/reviews-v1 --session bartek-icxzt --image docker.io/bmajsak/test:latest --route header:x=y  
----

=== Better insights from the CLI

When you want to get details about the sessions available in your namespace, the built-in response for `kubectl get sessions` is rather brief:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get sessions
NAME          AGE
bartek-jcsgl  9s
----

In this release we reworked it so you can easily see all the relevant information at hand.

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get sessions
NAMESPACE   NAME          REF NAMES       STRATEGIES          HOSTS                      ROUTE                    AGE
test-001    bartek-jcsgl  ["reviews-v1"]  ["prepared-image"]  ["feature-x.ike-demo.io"]  header:ike-id=feature-y  9s
----

=== Better insights of internal work

We've also enhanced the way we track status of our controller work. When you inspect `Session` CRD you can now easily see the conditions which describe the actions performed by the controller.

This is also exposed in e.g. OpenShift Console
