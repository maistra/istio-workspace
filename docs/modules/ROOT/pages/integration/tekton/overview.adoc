= Istio Workspace Tekton Integration

You can use Istio Workspace to prepare special routes from a CI system, e.g. per
PR to test/preview the changes before merging.

The Istio Workspace Tekton tasks wraps the Istio Workspace CLI into a Tekton Task
for easy usage within the Tekton/Openshift Pipelines CI system.
