= Contribution Guide

First and foremost thank you very much for your interest in our project and willing to make it better by contributing. 

Before we dive into technicalities on how to build and run it let's emphasize that there are other means of contributing which we value as much.

* Issues and feature requests.
* Documentation improvements.
* Blogging.
* Spreading the word on conferences and user groups.

== Reporting issues

It's important to us that the tool we are building gives our users smooth and enjoyable experience.

Filing issues is extremely valuable contribution and to make it easier for you we prepared a template which will guide you through this process.

== Pull Requests

We would love to see a pull request from, even if it's a typo.

There are not many strict rules or guidelines to follow, as we strive to automate as much as possible, however, if your work is non trivial please make sure there's associated issue with it. This will help us preparing release notes.

If you don't know where to start - have a look at https://github.com/Maistra/istio-workspace/labels/good%20first%20issue[good first issues].

== Development

=== Setup

Assuming that you have all the link:https://golang.org/doc/install[Golang prerequisites] in place, clone the repository first:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/maistra/istio-workspace $GOPATH/src/github.com/maistra/istio-workspace
----

TIP: Have a look how link:https://github.com/moovweb/gvm[Go Version Manager] can help you simplifying configuration
and management of different versions of Go.

We rely on following tools:

* https://golang.github.io/dep/[`dep`] for dependency management,
* https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[`golang-ci`] linter,
* https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo[`ginkgo`] for testing,
* https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports[`goimports`] for formatting,
* https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[`operator-sdk`] for code generation.

Build process takes care of installing those binaries on your behalf. You can also run `make tools` to install them.

=== Coding

From now on you are ready to hack. Open your favorite IDE and start right away! To build and test the code simply run `make`.

TIP: Run `make help` to see what other targets are available.

=== Testing

Unit tests are executed when using default `make` target. When developing you can also use https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#watching-for-changes[`ginkgo watch`] so they are ran whenever the change in the code occur. This makes feedback loop faster.

We also have end-to-end tests (`make test-e2e`) for which you need to have Kubernetes cluster with Istio installed. 

In our CI we rely on https://maistra.io/[Maistra] which bundles OpenShift and Istio. Visit their https://maistra.io/docs/getting_started/install/[installation guide] to see how else you can enable Istio in your cluster.
